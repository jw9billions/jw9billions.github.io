My goal is to become an innovative, productive, knowledgeable and high skilled SW engineer, with good knowledge, value, social consciousness and awareness, with inspirational love and care, to apply my knowledge and technology, to help people, to contribute my work and love to my community, to give back to our society and our future.

I am especially interested in virtual technology, artificial intelligence, machining learning and big data analysis. I always want to build a robotic servant to serve people, to heal disabled ones, to assist patients and elderly. Robotic machines can tirelessly serve people without any judgment. No mater who you are, how old you are, pretty or ugly, mean or loving, holy or evil, straight or guy, they simply do not judge. They just serve.

I want to sharpen my skills in JavaScript and Algorithm, and hope to learn Python pretty soon to build up good pipeline for my goal.

At the same time I also enjoy building websites, using great content to communicate with people with love, to support good feelings in my circle.
