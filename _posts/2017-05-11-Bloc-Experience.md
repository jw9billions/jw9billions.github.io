Speaking about my experience with Bloc, I cannot wait to brag my mentor Raj, who is so eager and dedicated to help me to learn. He adjusts his time and schedule based on my learning curve. He doubled his teaching hours to teach me in every session. I cannot be thankful enough that I picked very knowledgable and sympathetic mentor to guide me in my coding journey to stand up in the field.

Of course, everybody struggled one way or the other. When I thought I could not continue, just wanted to throw the towel, suddenly it ended. I finished the project. It is done!

I do not deny that some times I did get bad quality learning curve. I struggled, and questioned myself if it is for me. Though, today I am still not sure about the answer, but I have to say, my mentor put so much attention and time. He doubled the time to teach me at every single session. Thanks God, I am lucky!

After this experience, I say the best experience in Bloc is with my mentor. They are absolutely the super stars of Bloc. Thank you!
