## Explanation

To create chat rooms for people to share and chat. Each chat rooms can have their own names. The conversations and users are updated at real time both in data center and chat rooms.

## Problem

How to create a site that takes data directly from massive users (such as username, messages, or creating a new chat room), update the data simultaneously both at website and server, to provide user real time chatting experience? THE ROOM IS SO CROWDED!

## Solution

AngularJS provides great frame works, and that made the whole process faster and quicker. I combine Angular Firebase, Bootstrap, and cookies (which can directly taking the data and inputs from users), and keep data update in server and browser at real time.
