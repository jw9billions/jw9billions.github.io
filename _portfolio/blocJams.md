## Problems
There are a few big challenges in the project based on users' behavior.

Considering all instances when a user click a song button. The user may start a new song, or to pause the song if he is listening, or continue to listen the same song after pausing, or switch to a new song in middle.

There are Play Bar and Volume Bar also need to be adjusted simultaneously when users drag the bars back and forth, or listen a song, vise versa.  

I need to structure the whole project, and have everything synchronized and work seamlessly. So how to create my music Jam?

## Solution

Comprehended all instances with algorithm analysis, conditional functions (or nested conditions) built the website. Segregated the whole project into three main pages, and interface each other based on users' experiences.
