## About the project

In this project I applied Angular JS and Jquery, refactory my last Music Jams project.
By using Directive and injecting dependencies in Angular modules, I saved a lot of code and time.

This project is to build a music player, with sound control, volume control, and collections of musics like a library, and fit into all devices and screen sizes.

## Problems
It requires a lot of code if I only Javascript and Jquery. How to shorten it with Angular JS?

Considering all instances when a user click a song button. The user may start a new song, or to pause the song if he is listening, or continue to listen the same song after pausing, or switch to a new song in middle.

There are Play Bar and Volume Bar also need to be adjusted simultaneously when users drag the bars back and forth, or listen a song, vise versa.  

If I only use Javascript and Jquery, it require a lot of code and time. So
I need restructure the whole project with Angular JS, and have everything synchronized and work seamlessly.
